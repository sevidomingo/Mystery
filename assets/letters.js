      <p><strong>My love,</strong></p>

      <p>
        I just want to preface this by saying I am not a writer. So, this is especially
        difficult to write as I don’t know how to start a letter to someone who already
        knows the worst and best parts of me. I remember how you once worried about
        beginnings — whether greetings were too stiff, whether skipping them would be
        dishonest, whether starting wrong would ruin the truth. So I’ll do what you did.
      </p>

      <p><em>I’ll start uncertain, but honest.</em></p>

      <p>
        Redemption was a hard concept to grasp for me. Maybe because I didn't believe in it.
        Maybe I didn't believe in me. But, now that I'm slowly climbing out the hole life
        and myself dug out, I think I'm starting to get it. Redemption isn't pretending
        nothing happened, it's learning from your past to build a better future, starting
        in the present. It's the kind that doesn't rush forgiveness, the kind that
        understands healing isn't linear —
        <em>na minsan, uulit at uulit before it feels better.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m sorry my eyes wandered. It was never a lack within you — it was a lack of love
        within myself. Though, I'm sure you're well aware of that now. I just wanted to say
        it again :))
      </p>

      <p>
        I could give a million reasons why my life led me there. I could explain every
        step, every fracture, every moment of weakness. But reasons are not repairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <del>What mattress</del> <em>(fuck)</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What matters is this:</strong><br>
        going forward, I choose differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        I choose to be truthful, I choose integrity.<br>
        I choose to be faithful, I choose love.<br>
        The love I want, I choose to risk it all.<br>
        I choose you — not just in feeling, but in action.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think about puzzles a lot lately. How at first, nothing fits. You force pieces
        together because you want the picture <em>now</em>, and all you do is bend the edges.
        Maybe that was just me.
      </p>

      <p>
        But once you slow down, once I stop insisting on the whole image too early,
        patterns begin to show. One piece clicks. Then another. And suddenly, what felt
        impossible starts to make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t think we were broken, especially not beyond repair. I think we were
        unfinished. Still writing our story, still painting our picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        You once wrote about wanting to keep my words somewhere safe, as if they were
        fragile things you didn’t want to lose. I didn’t understand then how sacred that
        kind of care was. Though, it's a little late, better than never?
      </p>

      <p>
        You gave me a handkerchief once — an apology folded into fabric, a promise to stop
        my tears. I think you probably need it more than I do now. But I won't offer it
        back, instead I give you my shoulder
        <em>(shuddup I know I'm too short).</em>
        The handkerchief is mine to keep.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yes — maybe I’m selfish — but in this,
        <em>ikaw lang ang gusto kong hawakan.</em>
        You’re all mine in the way that matters:
        <strong>chosen, protected, stayed with.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        You wrote about how love didn’t arrive suddenly for you — how it built itself
        slowly, like shifting tides, memories layering, meaning accumulating. Loving you
        has felt the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s choosing again after disappointment. Staying when leaving would be easier.
        Learning how to be gentle without being careless.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t promise perfection.<br>
        <strong>I promise presence.</strong><br>
        I promise to try.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to rebuild what we had, together. I want to sit with you while the picture
        is still unclear, trusting that if we keep going — patiently, honestly — the image
        will reveal itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Hindi agad.</em><br>
        <em>Pero darating.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        So this is me, writing anyway.<br>
        Owning what I broke.<br>
        Choosing to do better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choosing you — again, and on purpose.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Always and forever, mahal ko.</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sa’yo pa rin,</strong><br>
        Sevi

      <p><strong>Jay,</strong></p>

      <p>
        I’ve been sitting with this for a while, trying to find words that are
        <em>honest without being heavy</em>, and <em>clear without being final</em>.
        I don’t want to speak from hurt, and I don’t want to say anything that
        boxes either of us into something we didn’t consciously choose.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What we had mattered to me.</strong> It was real, and it wasn’t small.
        There was care, connection, laughter, and a closeness I don’t take lightly.
        I don’t regret that, and I don’t want to rewrite it just because things are
        complicated now.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also need to be honest with myself. The way I’ve been holding on —
        living in uncertainty, absorbing pain, trying to understand where I stand —
        has been hurting me more than I can keep carrying.
        That doesn’t erase how I feel about you.
        It just means I need to change how I show up so I’m not stuck in a cycle
        that keeps reopening the same wounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not asking you to decide anything.
        I know where you are right now is your choice, and I respect that.
        This isn’t me trying to convince you, rush you, or pull you back into something
        you’re not ready for.
        It’s simply me acknowledging my limits with care.
      </p>

      <p>
        I still appreciate you deeply —
        <em>who you are, what we shared, and the ways we showed up for each other
        when things were good</em>.
        I hope, in time, whatever path you’re on feels lighter and more grounded.
        And I hope that if our paths ever cross again in a meaningful way,
        it’s from a place that feels <strong>healthier and kinder for both of us</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there ever comes a time when you want to reach out with
        <strong>clarity and intention</strong> —
        not out of habit, guilt, or uncertainty — you can.
        I’m not closing the door, and I’m not erasing the past.
        I just can’t stay in a space of resentment, distance, or half-presence anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever happens, <em>I’m grateful for what was real between us</em>.
        I truly wish you well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always,<br>
        I <strong>wambamtripledamn love you</strong>, Ji.<br>
        — <em>Sevi</em>
      </p>

      <p class="closing">This is where it ends.</p>
